To identify plugins that are adding extraneous CSS, try running [code coverage](https://developers.google.com/web/updates/2017/04/devtools-release-notes#coverage) in Chrome DevTools. You can identify the theme/plugin responsible from the URL of the stylesheet. Look out for plugins that have many stylesheets in the list which have a lot of red in code coverage. A plugin should only enqueue a stylesheet if it is actually used on the page.","uses-responsive-images":"Upload images directly through the [media library](https://wordpress.org/support/article/media-library-screen/) to ensure that the required image sizes are available, and then insert them from the media library or use the image widget to ensure the optimal image sizes are used (including those for the responsive breakpoints). Avoid using `Full Size` images unless the dimensions are adequate for their usage.
