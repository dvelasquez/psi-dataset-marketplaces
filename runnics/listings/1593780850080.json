You can identify the theme/plugin responsible from the URL of the stylesheet. Look out for plugins that have many stylesheets in the list which have a lot of red in code coverage. A plugin should only enqueue a stylesheet if it is actually used on the page.","offscreen-images":"Install a [lazy-load WordPress plugin](https://wordpress.org/plugins/search/lazy+load/) that provides the ability to defer any offscreen images, or switch to a theme that provides that functionality.
